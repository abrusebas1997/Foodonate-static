# Foodonate-static-website

Foodonate is a nonprofit tech organization that wants to end hunger in San Francisco
with good quality and nutritious food. Furthermore, in the future, we would like to 
reintroduce homeless people into the workforce by providing technical training for them
to be prepared to work. We operate by collecting leftovers from any type of food business.
After that, we make sure all the food is inspected and determined to be in good quality and packaged. 
Then, we deliver to shelters for people in need.
